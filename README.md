#Ghost Nav (WIP)

##Concept

Ghost nav is (or at this stage, will be) a radial menu that is accessable from anywhere on a touch device screen simply by tapping and holding.  It is designed to alleviate the issue of reaching the traditional corner/hamburger navigation on increasingly large handheld devices.

##How it will work

Tap and hold on the screen, and a ring of menu items will appear surrounding a "puck" under your thumb.  Simply drag the puck to the desired link, release, and off you go.  Simple, easy, and accessible on any size device.

##What's left to do

Most stuff.
